-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lemonade Stand is a game meant for those who want to explore a global marketplace and watch the invisible hand of an economy work its magic. By allowing a person to choose from a variety of roles, the game offers players a chance to get a taste of a multifaceted and dynamic market. 

Just like in real life, the market is heavily influenced by the environment, and thus a key element is location; location dictates all: from resources available to even governmental policies. This game, in its essence, will be quite complex, but so is the real world. 

## Gameplay
### Beginning
At the start of the game, a player will load up into the economy and must make a selection on how they would like to participate. The following [roles](#roles) are available: 
 
 - [Farmer](#farmer) (Lemon, Sugar)
 - [Wholesaler](#wholesaler)
 - [Business Owner](#business-owner)

 *Other roles could be added, but for now, I don’t want to overcomplicate things. Certain aspects of the market will be managed by the computer and later can be adapted for a human role (i.e a player can manage the equipment needed for the farmers or even consumers of the lemonade)*

 In an oversimplified diagram, the supply chain of the economy will look something like this:
 >Farmer => Wholesaler => Owner

### <a name="roles"></a> Roles
In essence, each player will have different responsibilities depending on their selected role. Other than maintaining your ability to participate in the market, there is no given objective; it is up to the player on what they would like to achieve. Each player is able to vote for local or global policies (more on that later) and may be restricted to certain actions and locations. A player’s decisions within the game for their given role will impact them and subsequently the rest of the market. 

## <a name="farmer"></a>Farmer

 The root of the supply chain; the farmer is responsible for providing the world with tasty lemons (or sugar). While farmers can set up operations anywhere, location matters; just like in real life, certain habitats aren’t as suitable for different crops. 

 The player will need to maintain their crop yield; they must buy and use water or other supplies (tbd for now). 

Lastly, the farmer can add their yield as available to wholesalers. 

*For now, the game will just require a farmer to water their crops every so often (could be a fun little animation). In the future, if we want to get super fancy, we can add local weather patterns and seasons to impact yield.*

## <a name="wholesaler"></a>Wholesaler
The middleman of the supply chain; the wholesaler is responsible for acquiring lemon (or sugar) in bulk from the available farmers. Like farmers, wholesalers can set up operations anywhere, however, location once again matters; transportation methods can impact costs. For instance, a player may set up shop super close to the farmers, however, in order to reach potential clients, it might require different and costly modes of transportation. 

## <a name="business-owner"></a>Business Owner
Effectively the final stage of the supply chain; the business owner is responsible for acquiring materials from wholesalers to sell LEMONADE! The business owner takes a lot of responsibility; the role will be for those looking to live the life of a CEO like they have always wanted to (haha). The owner must also hire workers (for now, these can be NPCS).
